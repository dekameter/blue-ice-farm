# Minecraft Ice Farm Simulator

Simulates the generation of a Minecraft ice farm and outputs a comma-separated line for each size, minimum duration, maximum duration, average duration, and median duration (all in ticks). If the size is greater than 7, than an X pattern is used for the water sources; otherwise, only a single diagnal is used.

At the time I wrote this in 2021, the goal was to better optimize ice farming for blue ice based on both the size of the ice farm and at what percentage yield to clear out the farm.
